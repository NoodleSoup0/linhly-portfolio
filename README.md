# Linh's Portfolio Website

An interactive personal portfolio built with modern web technologies, designed to showcase my computer science and data-focused projects through calm, playful interaction.

Rather than a static list of work, this site explores how motion, structure, and narrative can guide visitors through my experience and projects in a way that’s both human and recruiter-friendly.

## About Sensitive Data

Some research work involved sensitive or restricted data.  
For those projects, this site links to **posters or write-ups** instead of source code.  
I’m happy to discuss technical approaches, tradeoffs, and system design in interviews.
